1.0a2

	- Avoid potential crash from cellData being null during rapid resize events.
	- WPF performance improved thanks to assistance from Curtis.
	- Replaced previous commonality display with grid view.
	 - Much faster, more appropriate.
	 - Allows for column re-ordering.
	 - Native support for column headers.
	 - Used Curtis' example, but added parallel processing compatibility to try and speed things up where possible.

1.0a1

	- Prototyping.
	 - Allow for save to CSV (debug and validation of reload)
	 - Status bar and progress bar.
	  > Working on delegates to update these.
	   - Working on progress feedback for large datasets.
	 - Add ability to parse CSV from file.
	 - Menu bar added.
	 - Pushed table UI buildout into task to avoid blocking UI display.
	 - Implemented code to build out a 'random' CSV input table to test the pipeline.
	 - Extract commonality patterns per-row and set up the colors.
	 - Ensure color modulation is not same-channel for adjacent cells.
	 - Construct a table from labels with text and color displayed.
	 - Place into a scrollable to avoid issues.
	 - Make use of parallel processing to speed up data processing; UI build is gated by single-thread UI mandate.

	 ! UI update during table build is still not where I'd like it to be...
	 ! Need to be able to handle row and/or column headers
	 ! Need to be able to mark pass/fail
